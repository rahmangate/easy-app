Hereâ€™s an updated README file with instructions to clone the repository, set up the EasyTeam SDK, and configure necessary environment variables:

# Welcome to your EasyTeam app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahmangate/easy-app.git
   cd easy-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install EasyTeam SDK prerequisites**

   - Install `react-native-safe-area-context` and `react-native-url-polyfill`:

     ```bash
     npm install react-native-safe-area-context react-native-url-polyfill
     ```

   - Import `react-native-url-polyfill` at the top of your entry-point file to ensure the polyfill is applied automatically:

     ```javascript
     import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
     ```

4. **Install EasyTeam SDK components**

   To integrate EasyTeam front-end components, follow these steps:

   - Create a `.npmrc` file with the following content:

     ```
     @easyteam:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
     ```

   - Set up the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable as provided by the EasyTeam support team.

   - Run the following command to install EasyTeam components:

     ```bash
     npm install @easyteam/ui
     ```

5. **Add Configuration Variables**

   Add the following required variables in your `config/index.js` file:

   ```javascript
   export const PARTNER_ID = '<YOUR_PARTNER_ID>';
   export const BASE_API = '<YOUR_BASE_API_URL>';
   export const BASE_PATH = '<YOUR_BASE_PATH>';
   ```

   Replace `<YOUR_PARTNER_ID>`, `<YOUR_BASE_API_URL>`, and `<YOUR_BASE_PATH>` with the appropriate values provided by EasyTeam.

## Set Up EasyTeam SDK

1. **Wrap your app with the `EasyTeamProvider`**

   In the root of your React Native app, import the `EasyTeamProvider` from the SDK and wrap your app with it:

   ```javascript
   import { EasyTeamProvider } from '@easyteam/ui';

   <EasyTeamProvider
     token="<YOUR_TOKEN>"
     employees={[]}
     basePath={BASE_PATH}
     customFont={null}
     isGlobalTimeTrackingEmbed={false}
   >
     <App />
   </EasyTeamProvider>
   ```

   Update the `token`, `employees`, `customFont`, and `isGlobalTimeTrackingEmbed` props as needed.

## Run the App

1. **Use Node.js version 20+**

   ```bash
   nvm use 20
   ```

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## Get a Fresh Project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
